# Router entries and exits

Program receives a sequence of N pairs ```(X, Y)```, ```X = {'E', 'S'}``` and ```Y``` is a integer.
If ```X = 'E'```, the entry must be stored, if ```X = 'S'```, the first entry must be removed and displayed.

Example:
(E, 10) => store 10
(S, 4) => remove 10
display 10 4
