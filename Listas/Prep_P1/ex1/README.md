# Implementation of a DEQUE (Data structure)

This type of structure can:
- push at the beginning
- push at the end
- pop from the beginning
- pop from the end
- peek at the beginning
- peek at the end

## Two types of implementation:

- static: sequential memory allocation
- dynamic: linked elements, no sequential memory allocation

## Operation Time Complexity
- push (beginning or end): $\theta$(1)
- pop (beginning or end): $\theta$(1)
- peek (beginning or end): $\theta$(1)
